# Password Validator Kata
Kata made in GofiGeeks event "TDD en acci√≥n - Resolviendo la kata password validator"

Design and implement a software that validates a password applying TDD.

The password will be introduced by the user (as an argument of the method) and should return if the password is valid or not.

A valid password should meet the following requirements:

- Have more than 8 characters
- Contains a capital letter
- Contains a lowercase
- Contains a number
- Contains an underscore

This kata has been done following the **Object Calisthenics** steps introduced by **Jeff Bay** (You can find more info about this [here](https://developerhandbook.stakater.com/content/architecture/object-calisthenics.html))
